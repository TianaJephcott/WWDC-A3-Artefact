## Introduction
This project is a piece of generative art, it is a space themed scene and includes elements of interactivity and randomisation to allow users to have an interesting and unique experience each time the code is run. It was made using the open-source sketchbook software Processing and the high-level coding language Python.
## Project Status
This project is complete and working
## Technologies
* Processing 3
* Python 3.6
## Set Up
To run this project follow the steps below:
1. Download the processing application to your computer at processing.org 
2. Once downloaded open the sketchbook
3. The sketchbook will automatically open in Java, this needs to be changed to Pyhthon
4. To open the sketchbook in Python click the button in the top right and click 'manage modes'
5. From there download Python into processing
6. If done correctly, the button in the top right of the sketchbook should now say 'python' 
7. Copy and paste the code from 'Final_Artefact.pyde' into your sketchbook 
8. Press the run button
9. The image should look like this<img width="799" alt="Screen Shot 2022-10-30 at 3 22 42 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116044547/198862540-7aa3a38b-c7a9-4918-8e79-4779a99452b2.png">
10. To change the placement and size of the planet exit the image and run again
## Sources
The planet was created by following a tutorial by TheBuffEd, certain elements were altered to fit the final artefact. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj--Mc-c2JU&list=LL&index=6&t=100s).
